Qus:-How Many Basic Types Of Functions Are Available In Python?

Ans:- In Python, there are primarily three basic types of functions:

Built-in Functions: These are functions that are pre-defined in Python and are always available for use.
                    Examples include print(), len(), type(), int(), etc.

User-defined Functions: These are functions that you define yourself to perform specific tasks. 
                        You create them using the def keyword.

example:- def my_function():
              print("Hello from my function!")
          my_function()

Output:-Hello from my function!

Anonymous (Lambda) Functions: These are small, unnamed functions defined using the lambda keyword. 
                              They are often used for short, throwaway functions.

example:- square = lambda x: x * x
          print(square(5))  

Output: 25
