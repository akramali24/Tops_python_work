How will you set the starting value in generating random numbers?

Ans:-The starting value for generating random numbers is set using a process called "seeding." 
     The seed is a value used to initialize the random number generator (RNG). 
     Once the RNG is seeded, it will produce a sequence of random numbers based on that seed.

example:-import random

         random.seed(42)
         print(random.randint(1, 100))
         print(random.random())
