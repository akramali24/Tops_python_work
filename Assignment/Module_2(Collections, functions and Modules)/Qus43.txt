Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

Ans:-The zip() function in Python is used to combine multiple iterables (like lists or tuples) element-wise into a single 
     iterable of tuples. Each tuple contains elements from the input iterables at the corresponding positions.

Example1:-names = ["akram", "abbas", "mohammad"]
        ages = [25, 30, 35]

        for name, age in zip(names, ages):
            print(f"{name} is {age} years old.")

Output:-akram is 25 years old.
        abbas is 30 years old.
        mohammad is 35 years old.

Example2:- keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
           values = ["akram", 25, "New York"]

           person_dict = dict(zip(keys, values))
           print(person_dict)
 
Output:-{'name': 'akram', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
