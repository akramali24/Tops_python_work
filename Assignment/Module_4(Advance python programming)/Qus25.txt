Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What is A Constructor In Python?

Ans:- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class 
      (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class 
      (called a superclass or base class). This enables code reusability and the creation of a 
      hierarchical relationship between classes.

Example of inheritance:-

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement this method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!

__init__:- __init__ is a special method in Python, often referred to as the constructor. It is called automatically 
           when a new instance of a class is created. This method allows you to initialize the instance's attributes 
           and perform any setup required when an object of the class is instantiated.

Constructor:- A constructor is a special method used to initialize newly created objects. Itâ€™s defined in a class with 
              the name __init__. When you create an instance of a class, Python automatically calls the __init__ method 
              to set up the initial state of the object.
