What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?

Ans:- To check whether an object o is an instance of class A in Python, you can use the isinstance() function. 

The syntax is:-

isinstance(o, A)

This function returns True if o is an instance of A or a subclass of A, and False otherwise.
