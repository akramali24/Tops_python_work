Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

Ans:- Yes, a single except block can handle multiple exceptions in Python. You can do this by specifying a tuple
      of exception types in the except clause. Hereâ€™s an example:

example:-

try:
    # Some code that might raise an exception
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
