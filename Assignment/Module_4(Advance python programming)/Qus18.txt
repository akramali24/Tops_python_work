What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?

Ans:- The expression „1‟ == 1 compares a string ("1") to an integer (1). Since Python's == operator does not perform
      type coercion, it checks for both the value and the type. Because the types of the two operands are different 
      (one is a string and the other is an integer), the comparison returns False.

example:-

result = "1" == 1
print(result)  # Output: False

The output is False because the string "1" is not equal to the integer 1.
