Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

Ans:- Exception handling in Python is a way to handle errors or other exceptional conditions that occur during the 
execution of a program. It allows a program to continue running even when an unexpected event happens. This is done 
using the try, except, else, and finally blocks.

Type of error in python:-

ZeroDivisionError: Raised when division or modulo by zero takes place.

IndexError: Raised when trying to access an index that is out of range.

KeyError: Raised when trying to access a key that is not in a dictionary.

ValueError: Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.

TypeError: Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.

FileNotFoundError: Raised when a file or directory is requested but doesnâ€™t exist.
