How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets.

Ans:- Exceptions are handled using the try, except, and finally blocks. Here is a breakdown of how each part works 
      along with some code snippets:

1. try Block
The try block contains the code that might raise an exception.

2. except Block
The except block catches and handles the exception. You can catch specific exceptions or all exceptions.

3. finally Block
The finally block contains code that will run no matter what, whether an exception occurred or not.

example:- 

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code that runs if a ZeroDivisionError is raised
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    # Code that always runs, regardless of an exception
    print("Execution completed.")
