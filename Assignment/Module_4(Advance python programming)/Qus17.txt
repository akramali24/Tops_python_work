When is the finally block executed?

Ans:- The finally block is executed after the try and any except blocks have finished executing, 
      regardless of whether an exception was raised or handled. This makes it useful for performing 
      cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources, which need to happen no matter what.

example:- 
def divide(x, y):
    try:
        result = x / y
        print("Result:", result)
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        print("Caught an exception:", e)
    finally:
        print("Executing finally block")
