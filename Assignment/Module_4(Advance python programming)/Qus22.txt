How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class

Ans:- A class is defined using the class keyword. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances), 
      encapsulating data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) relevant to that object.

self:- The self parameter in the method definitions inside a class refers to the instance of the class. 
       It allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class in Python.

Example Of A Python Class:-

class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"
    
    def get_age(self):
        return self.age

my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 5)

print(my_dog.name)       # Output: Buddy
print(my_dog.age)        # Output: 5
print(my_dog.bark())     # Output: Buddy says woof!
print(my_dog.get_age())  # Output: 5
