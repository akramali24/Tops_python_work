What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

Ans:-Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) concepts are the fundamental principles upon which 
     object-oriented programming (OOP) is based. These concepts help in designing and implementing
     programs in an organized and modular manner.

multiple inheritance supported in java:-

Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes. This means a class cannot extend more than one class. 
The reason for this limitation is to avoid complexity and simplify the design, especially to prevent the
"Diamond Problem," where a class can inherit from two classes that have a common ancestor.
