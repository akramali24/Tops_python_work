When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?

Ans:- The else block in a try-except-else statement is executed only if no exceptions are raised in the try block. 
      
Here is the structure:-
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except SomeException:
    # Code that runs if an exception is raised in the try block
else:
    # Code that runs if no exception is raised in the try block

So, the else block will run under these conditions:

1.The code in the try block executes without raising any exceptions.
2.None of the except blocks are executed.

example:- 
try:
    x = 1 / 1  # No exception here
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Caught a division by zero!")
else:
    print("No exceptions were raised.")  # This will be executed
